# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.


There are two folders. 

1. Container Components = These use `bits` or overload bits to show data.

2. Bit Components = these are raw repeatable components. 


_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._
